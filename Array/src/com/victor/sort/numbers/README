Sort algorithm summary:
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Bubble sort
- Shell sort
- Merge sort
- Heap sort
- Quick sort
- Quick3 sort

Selection sort: basic sort algorithm, easy to implement, almost no use

Insertion sort: best use for nearly sorted array

Bubble sort: kind of like Insertion sort, good for nearly sorted array

Shell sort: good for large size array, can be considered as a complimentary for Insertion sort

Merge sort: use for stable

Heap sort: simple to implement, but not stable, typically used for academic use

Quick sort: excellent for general-purpose sort

Quick3 sort: highly adaptive in the very common of sorting with few unique keys
